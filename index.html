<p>This Java program measures statistics of baseball players and takes their batting averages. Then it averages all the players hits and at-bats to create the team batting average. The team and players I have used are from the SF Giants with stats from the current 2016 season as of October 6, 2016</p>

<p>To run the program run the driver as a java application.</p>
